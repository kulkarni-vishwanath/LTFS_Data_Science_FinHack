## L&T Financial Services & Analytics Vidhya presents ‘DataScience FinHack’.
In this FinHack, you will develop a model for our most common but real challenge ‘Loan Default Prediction’ & also, get a feel of our 
business! If your solution adds good value to our organization, take it from us, Sky is the limit for you!

## Problem Statement
### Vehicle Loan Default Prediction
Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. This has led to the tightening up of vehicle loan underwriting and increased vehicle loan rejection rates. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions. This warrants a study to estimate the determinants of vehicle loan default. A financial institution has hired you to accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments) on the due date. Following Information regarding the loan and loanee are provided in the datasets:
* **Loanee Information (Demographic data like age, income, Identity proof etc.)** 
* **Loan Information (Disbursal details, amount, EMI, loan to value ratio etc.)**
* **Bureau data & history (Bureau score, number of active accounts, the status of other loans, credit history etc.)**

### Data Description
* train.csv contains the training data with details on loan as described.
* test.csv contains details of all customers and loans for which the participants are to submit probability of default.
### Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated on **area under the ROC curve** between the predicted probability and the observed target.
